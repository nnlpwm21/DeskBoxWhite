///
/// Runs <c>ShellExecuteEx</c> on the .lnk with the dropped paths appended as
/// arguments, so Windows resolves the link: stored arguments are prepended, the
/// link's working directory and elevation flag apply, link tracking still
/// resolves a moved target, and packaged-app activation behaves natively. The
/// dropped paths are the only thing we format ourselves.
///
/// This is not a shell command line and nothing here goes through cmd.exe: the
/// paths travel in <c>ShellExecuteEx</c>'s <c>lpParameters</c> channel to the
/// application the shortcut points at. Because every path is wrapped in double
/// quotes and a double quote is a reserved character in Windows file and folder
/// names, a path cannot end its argument early — the quoting is the complete
/// escaping story, and <see cref="SanitizeDroppedPaths"/> enforces that
/// invariant instead of assuming it.
///
/// Not using <see cref="ProcessStartInfo.ArgumentList"/>: it is silently ignored
/// when <c>UseShellExecute</c> is true (measured 2026-09-12 — the process starts
/// and the arguments are dropped), and it cannot be combined with the direct
/// CreateProcess route because a .lnk is not an executable image.
///
/// Deliberately not using the shortcut's own IDropTarget: on real hardware its
/// <c>DragEnter</c> accepts but <c>Drop</c> answers DROPEFFECT_NONE and Windows
/// then shows its "Open with" picker (measured 2026-09-12, see
/// docs/architecture/drop_on_shortcut_open.md §10.2), which is neither the
